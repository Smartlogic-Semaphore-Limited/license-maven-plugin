Demonstrates that the aggregateAddThirdParty goal can handle long sibling project dependency chains in the same reactor, and that it resolves dependencies based on the right remote repositories list.

The project has parent A and children B, C, D, E with B depending on C, C dependending on D and D depending on E. The D dependency has a custom repository specified, and a dependency from that repo. When the plugin generates the license list, it should pick up the license for the dependency from the custom repo. E has a custom license specified, which should also be picked up.
